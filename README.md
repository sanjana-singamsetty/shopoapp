Sure! Here's an example of a Flutter application that integrates Firebase for user authentication using Firebase Authentication and data storage using Cloud Firestore:

1. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a new Flutter project and add the necessary dependencies in your `pubspec.yaml` file for Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
   - Follow the Firebase setup guide to create a new Firebase project, enable Firebase Authentication, and set up Cloud Firestore.

2. Initialize Firebase in your Flutter application:
   - In your Flutter project, import the necessary Firebase packages:
     ```dart
     import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';
     import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
     ```
   - Initialize Firebase in the `main` function:
     ```dart
     void main() async {
       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
       await Firebase.initializeApp();
       runApp(MyApp());
     }
     ```

3. Implement Firebase user authentication:
   - Create a new `AuthService` class for handling user authentication operations. This class will contain methods for user registration, login, and sign out using Firebase Authentication.
   - Here's an example implementation of the `AuthService` class:
     ```dart
     import 'package:firebase_auth/firebase_auth.dart';

     class AuthService {
       final FirebaseAuth _auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;

       Future<User?> signUp(String email, String password) async {
         try {
           final UserCredential userCredential = await _auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
             email: email,
             password: password,
           );
           return userCredential.user;
         } catch (e) {
           print('Error during sign up: $e');
           return null;
         }
       }

       Future<User?> signIn(String email, String password) async {
         try {
           final UserCredential userCredential = await _auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
             email: email,
             password: password,
           );
           return userCredential.user;
         } catch (e) {
           print('Error during sign in: $e');
           return null;
         }
       }

       Future<void> signOut() async {
         await _auth.signOut();
       }
     }
     ```

4. Use Firebase user authentication in your application:
   - Create a new Flutter `LoginPage` widget where users can enter their email and password to sign up or sign in.
   - Implement the necessary UI and integrate the `AuthService` methods for user authentication.
   - After successful authentication, you can store user data in Cloud Firestore.

5. Integrate Cloud Firestore:
   - In your Flutter project, you can use the `cloud_firestore` package to interact with Cloud Firestore.
   - Import the package and initialize it:
     ```dart
     import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

     FirebaseFirestore firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;
     ```
   - Use Firestore methods to read, write, and listen to data in Cloud Firestore.

This is a basic outline of how to integrate Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore into your Flutter application. You can find more detailed information and examples in the Firebase documentation for Flutter:

- [Cloud Firestore for Flutter](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/overview)
